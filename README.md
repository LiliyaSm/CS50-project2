# CS50 Project 2

### This is an online messaging service. Users are able to sign into the site with a display name, create chatrooms for chatting or join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users are able to send and receive messages with one another in real-time. My personal touch to this chat application is supporting deleting oneâ€™s own messages.

Technologies:
1. Python 3.7
2. Javascript
3. Flask
4. Bootstrap 4

* application.py - the main file contains all functions to render Flask pages. 
* loginRequired.py - login required decorator
* "templates" folder contains HTML files for rendering pages: index page, main and chat page. Layout.html contains an HTML skeleton of the header and body, connected scripts and displays the flashed messages if there are any.
* "static" folder contains three javascript files for every page, CSS and .jpeg files. 
* requirements.txt - list of all dependencies
